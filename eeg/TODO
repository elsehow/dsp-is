# 1 mindwave client...
modify mindwave client to push each raw value to a websocket stream
simple socket server listens...

# 2 wire up to FFT
somewhere (wherever), FRP-ify socket stream
and turn into stream of FFTs...

# 3 other packets
some data (signal quality) comes in at a diff rate...
send it over a diff stream somehow!!
